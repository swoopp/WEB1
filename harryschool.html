          <p>The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable.
          To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations
          were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.</p>
